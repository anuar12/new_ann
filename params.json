{"name":"Artificial Neural Network ","tagline":"1 Hidden Layer ANN","body":"## What is the stock price tomorrow and the day after?\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing variables from technical analysis and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) we are able to predict the variables (including the price) for the next day in a time-series format. \r\n\r\n\r\nANN is made up of 1 hidden layer, the sizes of layers are adjustable. The algorithm is back-propagation with gradient descent. There is also a checker of the gradient present to make sure the derivative is correct. Validation set is not present yet which means that the cost function can overfit the data.\r\n\r\nWritten in MATLAB.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
