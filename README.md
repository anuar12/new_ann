Three layer (1 Hidden Layer) Artificial Neural Network for time-series 
analysis of technical data of stocks for predicting the future price. 

Written in MATLAB, the code is not clean but yet working.

ANN supports and features:
    - Regularization
    - Variation of sizes of all layers
    - Optimized fmincg function for fast gradient descent
    - Random Initialization of weights
    - Checker of the gradient using the numerical method

ANN does not support:
    - Validation set (which should be the next big thing to add to a ANN)
